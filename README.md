# 🧠 AI Mastery Roadmap  

This repo is a **step-by-step journey to mastering AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning**.  
The pathway is split into 3 realistic stages:  

- **Junior Level (0–3 months)** → Fundamentals (Python, Math, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- **Mid-Level (3–9 months)** → Core Machine Learning (OOP projects, scikit-learn, Kaggle)  
- **Senior Level (1–2 years)** → Deep Learning & AI Systems (PyTorch, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, MLOps)

## 📂 Repo Structure  

- [`junior-level/`](junior-level/README.md) → **First 90 days** → Fundamentals + portfolio project  
- [`mid-level/`](mid-level/README.md) → **3–9 months** → Core ML + Kaggle projects + toolkits  
- [`senior-level/`](senior-level/README.md) → **1–2 years** → Deep Learning, deployment, research-level skills

## 💡 Closing Note  

This repo is designed for **long-term mastery** — not a 90-day crash course.  
- Junior (90 days) → Solid foundations & first portfolio project  
- Mid-level (6–9 months) → Core ML skills & Kaggle-ready  
- Senior (1–2 years) → Deep Learning, deployment, and applied AI research  

**“Consistency beats intensity. 2 hours a day = a new life in AI.”**
