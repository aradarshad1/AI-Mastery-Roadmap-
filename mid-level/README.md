# 🟡 Mid-Level — Core Machine Learning (3–9 months)

## 🎯 Goal  
Move from **tool user → tool builder** by mastering OOP, scikit-learn, and Kaggle ML projects.  
By the end, you’ll have a **DataCleaner toolkit** and ML portfolio projects.  

---

## ✅ Roadmap Checklist  
- [ ] OOP refresher (classes, inheritance, methods)  
- [ ] Build `DataCleaner` class (remove_nulls, normalize, standardize)  
- [ ] Error handling & logging  
- [ ] Modular design (split into files)  
- [ ] Unit testing basics  
- [ ] scikit-learn (pipelines, model evaluation)  
- [ ] Feature engineering (scaling, encoding)  
- [ ] Model metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, MSE)  
- [ ] Kaggle projects (Titanic, House Prices)

## 🛠 Projects  
- 🧹 **DataCleaner Toolkit** → OOP module for cleaning datasets  
- 📊 **Apply Cleaner** → multiple datasets (Sales, Crypto, Social)  
- 🤖 **Kaggle ML Projects** → Titanic survival, House Prices prediction  
👉 Final deliverable: **Portfolio Project #2**
