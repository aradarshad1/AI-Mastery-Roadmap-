# ðŸ”´ Senior-Level Roadmap (1â€“2 years)

**Goal:** Deep learning expertise with PyTorch, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, GANs, and MLOps.  

## Stage 1: Deep Learning Foundations
- PyTorch tensors, autograd, nn.Module, DataLoader  
- Training loops, optimizers (SGD/Adam), LR schedulers  
- Regularization (weight decay, dropout), initialization  
- Convolutional nets: LeNet â†’ ResNet; augmentation  

ðŸ“š Resources  
- *Deep Learning with PyTorch â€” Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga*  
- *Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow â€” AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron*  
- *Deep Learning â€” Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville*  

## Stage 2: Sequence & Language
- RNNs/GRU/LSTM, attention basics  
- Transformers (Encoder/Decoder, pretrained)  

ðŸ“š Resources  
- *Speech and Language Processing â€” Jurafsky & Martin*  
- *The Illustrated Transformer* â€” Jay Alammar (blog)  

## Stage 3: Advanced Topics
- GANs, self-supervised learning, RL  

ðŸ“š Resources  
- *Generative Deep Learning â€” David Foster*  
- *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction â€” Sutton & Barto*  

## Stage 4: MLOps & Deployment
- FastAPI, Docker, MLflow, DVC, monitoring  

ðŸ“š Resources  
- *Building Machine Learning Pipelines â€” Hannes Hapke*
